# hiveGo
Go Implementation of Hive game.

Based on [earlier version in Python](https://github.com/makatony/hiveAI), which was a bit slow to generate training data for a Reinforcement Learning AI -- future planned.

Just a toy project.

Thanks for Florence Poirrel for the awesome drawings, for the upcoming GUI.
